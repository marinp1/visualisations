# Visualisations
This repository contains different visualisations I've created, both dynamic and static.

## Average temperatures for location
Visualisation creates a box plot of temperature data fetched from the Finnish Meteorological Institute's Open Data platform. The data for average and extremes is fetched for each day and grouped by month.

Graph itself is created with plot.ly and is dynamic and the parameters can be changed.
